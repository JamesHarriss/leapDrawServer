# Running the server

To get this server up and running do an npm install in the root of the folder. Then if you want to run the server then all you need to do is type node server and then if there are no error. It should successfully run and tell you it's running on localhost on port whatever (probably 3000).

# React stuff

It uses react. To start using react, you'll need to use gulp as you're task runner. that should all be installed when you do npm install. But they are dev dependancies so they might not install unless you use a certain command. I don't know what that is, sorry!
